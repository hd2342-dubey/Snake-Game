# Snake-Game
Hungry Serpent is an addictive and classic snake game in which players control a small snake as it navigates through a confined area, searching for food to eat. The objective is to guide the snake towards the food, helping it grow longer and avoiding collisions with the walls or its own tail.

Gameplay:

Snake Control: Players use the arrow keys or swipe gestures (in touch-screen devices) to control the snake's movement. The snake moves in a continuous forward direction and cannot stop or move backward.
Food: Randomly scattered across the game area, there are delicious food items that the snake needs to consume to grow. Each time the snake successfully eats a piece of food, its length increases by one unit.
Growth and Challenge: As the snake grows longer, the game becomes progressively more challenging. The snake's body becomes more difficult to maneuver without colliding into the walls or itself.
Collision Detection:
Walls: If the snake's head collides with the game's boundaries or any obstacles, such as walls, the game ends.
Snake's Tail: If the snake's head collides with any part of its own tail, the game ends.
Scoring: The player's score increases with each piece of food consumed. The longer the snake becomes, the higher the score. The game can feature a leaderboard to track high scores among players.
Game Over: When the snake collides with an obstacle or its own tail, the game ends. The player can then choose to start a new game or exit the game.
